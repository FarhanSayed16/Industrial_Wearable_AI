## 1. Introduction

The textile manufacturing industry is a labour-intensive sector that plays a crucial role in the economic development of many countries, including India. Despite its importance, a large number of textile manufacturing units—especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs)—still rely on traditional methods for monitoring productivity, worker performance, and workplace safety.

These methods are largely manual, periodic, and reactive, resulting in delayed decision-making, inefficient resource utilization, and increased operational risks.

With the emergence of **Industry 4.0**, technologies such as **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Internet of Things (IoT)**, and **data analytics** are transforming manufacturing processes by enabling real-time monitoring and intelligent decision support. However, the adoption of advanced smart manufacturing systems in textile units remains limited due to:

- High implementation costs  
- Complex infrastructure requirements  
- Lack of technical expertise  

Wearable technology offers a promising, human-centric approach to bridge this gap. Wearable devices equipped with sensors such as accelerometers and environmental sensors can continuously capture real-time data related to:

- Worker movement  
- Posture  
- Task duration  
- Surrounding environmental conditions  

When integrated with AI-based analytics, this data can be transformed into meaningful insights for improving productivity, safety, and operational efficiency.

## 2. Statement of the Problem

Small and medium textile manufacturing units face the following challenges:

- Absence of real-time data on worker activity and shop-floor conditions  
- High dependence on manual observation and paperwork  
- Safety concerns due to repetitive tasks and unfavourable environmental conditions  
- Limited financial capacity to adopt expensive Industry 4.0 solutions

## 2A. Review of Literature

A review of existing literature indicates a growing interest in the application of **AI, IoT, and wearable technologies** in manufacturing environments.

Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of IoT-based sensor systems for:

- Real-time monitoring of machine performance  
- Energy consumption analysis  
- Environmental parameter tracking  

These systems improve operational efficiency and enable predictive maintenance but are largely **machine-centric**.

Research on wearable technology has primarily focused on:

- Healthcare monitoring  
- Occupational safety  
- Worker posture and fatigue detection  

Studies suggest that wearable devices can significantly reduce workplace injuries and improve ergonomic conditions. In industrial contexts, wearables have been explored for tracking worker movements and enhancing safety compliance.

Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques have been widely applied in manufacturing for:

- Defect detection  
- Process optimization  
- Predictive analytics  

However, most AI-driven solutions require:

- Large datasets  
- Advanced infrastructure  
- Substantial financial investment  

This makes them less suitable for small-scale textile units.  
**This research addresses this gap** by combining low-cost wearable sensors with basic AI analytics to create an affordable, human-centric, real-time data collection system.
