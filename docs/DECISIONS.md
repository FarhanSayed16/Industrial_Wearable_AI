## Decisions

| 2025-02-04 | **DB: Docker Postgres** | Consistent setup, no local Postgres install; user chose Docker. |
| 2025-02-04 | **Deployment: Laptop only** | No Raspberry Pi; all services run on single laptop. |
| 2025-02-04 | **Venv: One per service** | backend/, edge/, ml/ each have own .venv for isolated deps. |
